## Mathematical Explanation

### Surface Definition

The function $q(x, y) = (1 \cdot h + 1)^{(x/h)} + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 5}{10}y\right)$ describes a surface in 3D space where:
- The first term $(1 \cdot h + 1)^{(x/h)}$ grows exponentially with respect to $x$, influenced by the small parameter $h$. As $h$ approaches zero, this term emphasizes the growth rate.
- The second term $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi \cdot 5}{10}y\right)$ introduces oscillatory behavior in the $y$-direction, contributing periodic variations to the surface.

### Parametric Representation

The functions $xx(i) = 2 \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{10}i\right)$ and $yy(i) = 4 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{10}i\right)$ parameterize a circular path in the $xy$-plane:
- $xx(i)$ and $yy(i)$ trace a circle with radius 2 in the $x$-direction and radius 4 in the $y$-direction as $i$ varies. The period of the motion is determined by the factor of 10.

### Derivative Approximation

The derivatives $dxx(i)$ and $dyy(i)$ are computed using finite differences:
$dxx(i) \approx \frac{xx(i+h) - xx(i)}{h}$
$dyy(i) \approx \frac{yy(i+h) - yy(i)}{h}$
These derivatives represent the rate of change of the parametric functions with respect to $i$.

### Magnitude of the Gradient

The magnitude $Mag$ of the gradient vector is computed as:
$Mag = \sqrt{dxx(i)^2 + dyy(i)^2 + \left(\frac{q(xx(i+h), yy(i+h)) - q(xx(i), yy(i))}{h}\right)^2}$
This formula combines the changes in $x$, $y$, and $z$ to give a comprehensive measure of the surface's steepness at each point.

### Color Normalization

The normalization step scales the magnitude of the gradients to a suitable range for color mapping, using:
$\text{norm}(mag) = \frac{mag - Mag_{\min}}{Mag_{\max} - Mag_{\min}}$
This allows the visualization of gradient intensity using a colormap, enhancing the understanding of surface behavior.

### Vector Field Representation

The `quiver` function visualizes the direction and magnitude of the gradient at specific points on the surface, providing insight into the surface's curvature and behavior.
